jQuery Bootstrap Timepicker by Fletcher Johnston (Originally by François Gélinas)
========================================

What
----
This is a jQuery time picker plugin built to use Twitter Bootstrap3 styling.
Based on the jQueryUI Timepicker developed by François Gélinas which was built to match jQuery UI Widgets (specifically the jqueryUI date picker), this version of Timepicker no longer depends on jQueryUI. 
The plugin is very easy to integrate in your form for you time (hours / minutes) inputs.

Why
---
I modified this plugin to work with Bootstrap3 because it is the framework I use, and Bootstrap and jQuery UI are not compatible.

Requirements
------------
Works with jQuery 1.5.1 or higher.
Also requires Bootstrap3.

Licenses
--------
The plugin is licensed under the [MIT](https://github.com/fgelinas/timepicker/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt) and [GPL](https://github.com/fgelinas/timepicker/blob/master/GPL-LICENSE.txt) licenses.
